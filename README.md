## Conversational-IVR-Modernization-Framework
## Module 1 – Legacy System Analysis
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the documentation for **Module 1 – Legacy System Analysis** of the Conversational IVR Modernization Framework project.

The focus of this module is to analyze traditional VoiceXML (VXML)-based IVR systems (IRCTC use case), identify architectural limitations, and define integration requirements for modern Conversational AI platforms such as ACS and BAP.

This phase establishes the technical foundation required for modernizing legacy IVR systems while minimizing redevelopment effort.
